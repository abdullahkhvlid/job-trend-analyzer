Configuration Notes
Auto-refresh options are controlled from the sidebar in the Streamlit UI.

CSV input can be uploaded manually via the dashboard or auto-generated by the scraper.

Scraper runs in a separate thread to ensure dashboard responsiveness.

Known Issues & Troubleshooting
Scraper not working: Confirm selectors are up-to-date and target websites haven’t changed their layout.

Data not loading: Ensure the expected CSV file (linkedin_remoteok.csv) exists and matches schema.

UI unresponsive: Try increasing refresh intervals or disabling auto-refresh if your system is under heavy load.

Permission errors: Run the app with appropriate file system permissions.
